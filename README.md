## Requirements

- **Python packages** (specified in `requirements.txt`):
  - `requests`, `vcf`, `fastqc`
- **Bioinformatics tools**:
  - BWA, GATK, SnpEff, FastQC, Picard

Install Python dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Install and configure the additional tools as required.

---

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   cd <repository_directory>
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install bioinformatics tools**:
   Follow installation instructions for BWA, GATK, SnpEff, and other dependencies.

4. **Download reference genome**:
   - Use `download_data.py` in `utils/` to obtain reference files.

### Running the Pipeline

Scripts within `src/` can be run individually, or you can automate execution with one of the available workflow managers.

---

## Workflow Management

### SnakeMake

To run the pipeline using SnakeMake, configure `Snakefile` with sample paths, tools, and parameters, then execute:

```bash
snakemake -j 4  # Adjust job count as needed
```

### WDL (Cromwell)

For WDL-based execution, modify `Somatic_InputWDL.json` with your sample paths and parameters. Run with:

```bash
java -jar cromwell.jar run Somatic_workflow.wdl -i Somatic_InputWDL.json
```

### Nextflow

To use Nextflow, configure `Somatic_nextflow.nf` and execute:

```bash
nextflow run Somatic_nextflow.nf
```
